## Inspiration
*We were inspired by recent hurricanes and other disasters causing areas to be isolated.  These hard-to-reach areas prevented many, especially disabled and elderly, to not get the medication they need in time.  Many rescue workers also had to break into homes to find victims, some barely able to walk, unable to leave their homes, and did not have enough supplies to last.  We wanted to alleviate some of the causes/effects and the main demographic that may be vulnerable to this situation.*

## What it does
*Our code issues an accessibility-friendly website for disabled and elderly (additional accessibility for low-vision and blind people) before a disaster and determines if they are high, low or medium risk.  Data is shared to another website for emergency services and humanitarian aid to view and assess the next steps to preparation or/and recovery.  The website also alerts users of weather warnings from the _NOAA_ as well as show a map radar of their area.*

## How we built it
*We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS using VSC to share code amongst our group*

## Challenges we ran into
*The database and the map has a lot of difficulties in the set-up as well as overlaying the map tiles and implementing sound.*

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
*Getting the weather radar to show up on the map as well as alerts for specific areas to appear on the screen.*

## What we learned
*We learned how to use APIs from _National Weather Service_ and _Leaflet_ and learned _Firebase_ to share data between files.*

## What's next for Emergency Risk Assessment
*We envision ERA to be a lot more accessible for all as there are still some flaws with the accessibility.  Better weather warnings and hazards imaging overlay to allow more information to be relayed to users.*
